### Timeslots - effortlessly create timetables
The app is a work in progress. The idea behind it is to use React and Rust in tandem with Tauri to create a seamless desktop experience with a really fast backend, which will handle the algorithms. 

# Roadmap
- Manual creation of timetables, user-friendly drag and drop
- Assigning people to tasks
- Adding time blocks when people are unavailable
- Automatically finding the best timetable
- Saving the timetable in a common format (probably JSON)
- Choosing factors to optimize the timetable for, like break time, non-consecutive tasks for a worker
